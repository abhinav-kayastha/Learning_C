/*
Write a function called replace_char that takes two strings as parameters and returns an integer.
The first string is the string to modify and the second is a string containing two characters. The
function finds every occurrence of the first character of the second string and replaces them with
the second character. For example:
char text[80] = “I am so tired of Python. C is much better language”;
count = replace_char(test, “e3”);
The call above will find every occurrence of ‘e’ and replace it with ‘3’.
Prototype of the function:
int replace_char(char *str, const char *repl);
The function returns the number of characters replaced. The return value can be zero if no
characters were found or if the second string does not contain two characters.
Write a program that asks user to enter both strings and then calls replace_char. The program prints
both return value and the modified string if the return value is greater than zero. If the return value
is zero program prints “String was not modified”
